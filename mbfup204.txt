-- DOOM 'MBF' VERSION HISTORY --

Major Credits:

1) Doom is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software.
Engine Programming was done mainly by John Carmack.
The Doom source code was released December 23, 1997
(Linux port, without DMX sound library and original Mode-X planar graphics routines).

2) Boom is a source port created by TeamTNT. The design goals of the Boom project were to create
a source port of professional quality, fix bugs and remove limitations of vanilla Doom, and add
extra editing features, while keeping the same "feel" and "spirit" of the original Doom engine.
The final version of Boom was released on October 22, 1998. (v2.02)

3) MBF (Marine's Best Friend) is a source port created by Lee Killough after he left the Boom team.
It is regarded by some as Boom's successor. As with Boom, MBF was limited to running under MS-DOS.
MBF was relicensed under the GNU GPL. Latest MBF source and executable release by Killough is v2.03
from 1/8/1999.

Minor Credits:

4) Simon Howard 'Fraggle' worked on the above sourcecode in 2000, and offers it as mbf-with-fixes,
albeit without a compiled executable.
It includes License change to the GPL, some bug fixes and compilation fixes under later versions of Allegro.
-bug with 3key doors! (p_spec.c)
-blur effect fix (r_draw.c)
-stereo fix for allegro v3.12 (i_sound.c)
-bugfixes from lxdoom (z_zone.c) (VM block size bug/Memory wastage/...)
-fix asm (m_fixed.h / r_things.c) (GB 2014: now overwritten with julian's fixes)


5) Gerwin ("GB") worked on mbf-with-fixes

2013:
- Version changed to 2.04.
- Integrated Julian's compiler fix from Eternity Engine v3.33.02, as described on 06/12/01,
  including a new local allegro.h. (not yet including the inline ASM fixes)
- use param -ssg to enable supershotgun from doom2 in doom1, Requires ssg.wad resources.
- game automatically looks in the \iwad subfolder, when no iwad found in base directory. (d_main.c)
- The game+setup is compiled with a modded Allegro 3.00 Sound Blaster 2.0/Pro driver.
  Consisting of a sample rate fix for Sound Blaster Pro Compatible Sound Cards, such as the Crystal CS4232,
  which does not accept a DSP request for over 43478Hz in SB Pro emulation mode.
  At startup it also flushes DMA transfers that may still be pending.

2014:
- startup console now resembles the original look, with colored title bar (d_main.c).
- startup console lists wads and sound devices in more bright text (w_wad.c) (i_sound.c)
- compiler check in i_sound.c for allegro version: either 3.00 or later. (still no proper game exit with 3.12...)
- display sound and music device in startup console (i_sound.c)
- Changed Mode-X to flip between 2 pages instead of rotating between 4 pages. for next point:
- Added Dirty/Clean check to only transfer the full Statusbar to the video memory when necessary. Small FPS gain. (i_video.c)
- Added doomu.wad to iwad list (d_main.c).
- Safe mode invoked whe Windows NT OS is detected (d_main.c). See -safe parameter.
- Doom version 1.2 demo compatibility (from PrBoom+).
- Proper detection and selection of when to use VESA Banked or LFB access.
- Alternate hi-res blitting for modern ATI/AMD video cards.
- Automatic 640x480 video mode fallback when 640x400 is not avialable.
- option to show the framerate on the top right, obviously capped at 35 max. (mostly i_video.c).
  will now also show the video mode driver on the top left, whenever it is switched.

General bugfixes which have been found and documented by other people in the past:
- Poor memory scanning bugfix from PrBoom (z_zone.c)
- Format string bugfix from PrBoom (d_deh.c / i_main.c)
- Spawned monsters respawn at 0,0 bugfix (p_mobj.c)
- Demo Compatibility bugfix in T_MovePlane from PrBoom (p_floor.c), but with P_CheckSector.
- Demo Compatibility bugfix in P_CheckSight and P_CrossSubsector from PrBoom (p_sight.c)
- Demo Compatibility bugfix in P_SlideMove (p_map.c)
- Demo Compatibility bugfix in "Overlapping uses of global variables" (p_map.c)
- Demo Compatibility bugfix "MBF player bobbing rewrite causes demo sync problems" (p_user.c)
- Bugfix "DR doors corrupt other actions" (p_doors.c)
- Doom v1.2 Demo compatibility from PrBoom, all Credits to the PrBoom author(s)
  (g_game.c, p_enemy.c, p_floor.c, p_inter.c, p_map.c, pmaputl.c+.h, p_sight.c, p_spec.c)
- for upload no. 004: eternity fix; must check fileout for validity (d_deh.c)

Compiler Compatibility (GCC 4)
- Integrated Julian's fix from Eternity Engine v3.33.02, as described on 06/12/01:
  "fixes to the inline assembly in m_fixed.h and r_things.c that remove actual bugs in Killough's code,
  and also enable compilation on GCC 2.95.* and later. Unlike the lxdoom code, Julian's code does not
  seem to break wall sliding or any other game engine behaviors." (m_fixed.h / r_things.c)
- Changed wrong predefenition (p_spec.h): int EV_DoElevator ( line_t* line, elevator_e    elevtype );
- Commented out 5x useless and conflicting predefenitions (r_bsp.h)
- haleyjd: syntax fix in EV_DoGenCeiling (p_genlin.c)
- Commented out 2x useless and conflicting predefenitions (p_mobj.h)
- Found culprit of -O2 / -O3 Floating point errors: FixedDiv (m_fixed.h). Boom's FixedDiv is OK.
- Removed unused 'Secnum' from p_doors, and 'cheatstate' from am_map.c, and 'length' from g_game.c
  and 'episode' from p_spec.c and 'lh' from wi_stuff.c
- added (char *) typecast to variables in string handling routines (g_game.c)
- added (byte *) typecast to variables (d_net.c)
- added (char *) typecast to variables (d_deh.c)
- added string.h to emu8kmid.c
- Restored ability to compile without DOGS feature, m_menu.c d_main.c. Game only gets slower without options?
For upload no. 004:
- fixed compiler warning "++eventtail" undefined (d_net.c)
- fixed 4x compiler warnings, dereference pionters for sizeof (g_game.c)
- register heightmask changed to register int heightmask (r_draw.c))
- changed *src++; to ++src; (w_wad.c)
- Replaced m_fixed.h with the one from SMMU, old one tended to give 'Floating point errors' when using compiler optimizations
- Found and fixed serious bug concerning in_graphics_mode vs. disk_flash_icon. This bug surfaced when using GCC 2.9+

New startup parameters (2014):
-noasm    To use the C column+span drawing functions instead of the assembler ones: faster on some systems. (r_plane.c,r_segs.c,r_draw.h,r_draw.c,r_things.c)
-noasmx   For new C transfer routine of buffer to Mode-X planar screen. (mostly i_video.c)
-asmp6    To force use of ASM Pentium Pro transfer routine of buffer to Mode-X planar screen. (mostly i_video.c)
-nolfb    To prevent Linear frame buffer mode when using 640x400. Initially the game did not detect when to use VESA Banked or LFB. (mostly i_video.c)
-safe     Does not use nearpointer VGA access, Does not allow video mode-X (through not allowing page flipping option). Shows video mode driver on the top left, whenever it is switched.
-stdvid   Basic video settings 320x200; Mode 13h or VESA equivalent.
-bestvid  Best Quality video settings; High resolution etc.
-unlock   Unlocks the protection that prevents mods to load with a shareware Doom iwad
-nopm     Do not use Protected Mode bankswitching and pageflip in VESA video modes. Use real mode VBE 1.0 routines instead.
-lowdet   Low Detail Mode, rendering half the horizontal resolution (2015)
-noDehWad Do not load Dehacked lumps found inside WADs (2015) 

V2.04 Release History
Upload no. 002: 2014-09-24 v2.04 had broken the savegame functionality, now fixed (g_game.c)
Upload no. 003: 2014-09-27 replaced SHLDL instructions, as done in Duke3D / Doom Legacy. Gives 20% more FPS on Pentiums. (drawspan.s)
Upload no. 004: 2014-10-05 
                Now reliable results when using the latest DJGPP+GCC
                (This does require a more recent version of cwsdmpi.exe, and in windows 95/98 DPMI memory has to be set manually)
                Most if not all video access rewritten, added i_vgavbe.c, Video access now totally independant of Allegro
		(Display of the Disk Icon on the bottom right is currently disabled)
		Added 320x200 VESA mode support, replaces mode 13h+X when suitable
		Added: Hold Shift at startup to remain at bootup console
		Removed "number of player corpses option" as it was reported to cause network desyncs when changed
		Compiled with an allegro without hi-color mode support, also compiled without the Allegro Graphics drivers
Upload no. 005: 2014-10-06 
                Rewrote VESA page flipping and vsync, as Nvidia cards malfunctioned before
                Screen should shake a little when enabling page-flipping
		Vesa version now shown in mode string
Upload no. 006: Bugfix for 640x480 pageflipped which got broken, also added clearscreen beforehand.
                Fixed the pageflipping routine for NVidia cards.
                Switching into of mode-X got slightly broken, now fixed
                Made video modes + options selection and handling more resilient
		Added a message when video options are not available
		Removed translucency percentage option from the main screen to make room
Upload no. 007: 2014-10-13 
                Added Protected Mode bankswitching and pageflip routines (VBE 2.0). Frame rate increase is not impressive...
                Introduced parameter: -nopm.
		Fixed a bug where the frame rate counter messed up a variable from the the timedemo measurement.
                Intel GMA specific: LFB mode blank-screen procedure for intel graphics, as banked functions do not work in LFB mode!?
		 (note on intel GMA graphics: page flipping in windows XP will not really work, but it works fine in DOS)
		Centered the screen in 640x480 LFB mode
                Vesa modes now intialized with the LFB bit set (worked without though)
		Replaced conio.h with gppconio.h
Upload no. 008: 2014-10-19 
                Rewrote shift=pause at startup console
                Compiled allegro with bugfix in adlib driver (in fm_set_pitch), FM timbres now sound a lot better
		Compiled allegro with the doom 1 GB FM timbres as build-in default. Drums have not been replaced (yet)
		When using a Doom2 based iwad FM timbre file MBF_D2GM.IBK is loaded, which has a few modified instruments
		Themed setup.exe, and allegro.cfg is now replaced with setup.cfg
Upload no. 009: 2014-10-25 
                Modified adlib driver again: added Doom timbres for percussion. Now uses MUSlib lookup tables.
		Improved look of setup.exe.
Upload no. 010: 2015-10-13
                Added -lowdet parameter to invoke low detail graphics: rendering half the horizontal resolution.
                This should give about 10% more frames per sec.
                (The low detail drawcol and drawspan are only in C code, not in hand crafted asm)
		Now compiled with gcc493
		Renamed dprintf to dmprintf, for DJGPP 2.05 compatibility.
Upload no. 011: 2015-12-26 
                Added -noDehWad parameter to not load Dehacked lumps found inside WADs (d_main.c) 
                Again Rewrote shift=pause at startup console, as to disregard CapsLock.
Upload no. 012: 2016-01-04 
                Added 'Windows Sound System' (WSS) Digital Sound Driver: 16 bit Stereo, up to 44100 Hz.
		As the game currently does not obey setup.cfg, use the ULTRA16 environment variable to pass the details:
		For example "SET ULTRA16=530,1,7" for IO=0x530, DMA=1, IRQ=7. 
		This is digital driver number 7 in the game config. Tested with CS4232 SoundCard.
Upload no. 013: 2016-01-23 
                Removed MBF internal sound driver selection entirely. It now always loads setup.cfg settings. 
		The settings screen now displays the Sound and Music driver, with sufficent detail.
		Tweaked WSS sound driver. 
		Restyled setup.exe dialogs a little. Replaced the setup.exe font.
Upload no. 014: 2016-01-31 (C)
                Backported Allegro 3.12 ESS Audiodrive Sound Driver. Tested OK.
                Backported Allegro 3.12 Ensoniq Soundscape Sound Driver. Unable to test.
		Added Gus PnP (InterWave) Sound driver. Tested OK. Actually already worked with WSS driver.
		Note that the GUS PnP Music interface is not included.
		Changed WSS environment variable, example: SET WSS=A530 I7 D1
                GUS PnP now uses the ULTRA16 environment variable, example (6=dma/5=irq): SET ULTRA16=34C,6,5 
		Improved WSS driver.
		Reverted back to 1997 Compiler software.
Upload no. 015: 2017-07-03 
                Reverted 'sizeof' changes in g_game.c, as it broke storage of the leveltime in savegames.
		(Verified that 1999 format savegames can still be loaded by this version)
Upload no. 016: 2017-08-28
                -Made changes in WSS.C sound driver, to prevent tweaks meant for CS4232 sound chip being applied
		to a similar OPL3SAx sound chip. Also disabled one tweak entirely for all WSS cards.
                -Made changes in MPU.C music driver, to prevent lockup when using the older SB16 MPU together with
		SB16 Digital section. Also made this driver follow the guidelines better, with more status checks.
Upload no. 017: 2017-08-28
                Setup.exe: Scrolling font spacing fix. 
		Stereo no longer reversed in relation to setup ('sep' in i_sound.c). 
Upload no. 018: 2017-09-04
                -Setup.exe: Display detected DSP version for Sound Blaster cards.
		-Sound Blaster Pro driver reverses back the reversed stereo of the hardware (allegro: sound.c + sb.c). 
                -Made changes in SB.C digital sound driver, mainly to handle unexpected MPU-401 interrupts with SB16.
                -Setup.exe: bugfix: 22 kHz sample rate was not properly selectable in the dialog.
Upload no. 019: 2017-09-10
                -Fix in GUS-PnP driver detection routine, as it messed up the WSS driver in PCem v12.
                -More consistency between SB16, WSS and GUS-PnP drivers.
                -Increasedd DMA buffer size on SB16 sound hardware, to minimize Midi problems;
                 4096kB for SB16 DSP v4.11, 4.12, 4.13 / 2048kB for other SB16s.
                -Fixed sb.c regarding differences between SB 1.0, SB 1.5 and SB 2.0. Improved setup description.
                -Adlib/OPL driver; fix to prevent it probing an Ultrasound port and messing up the codec.
                -Setup.c fixed bug where Frequency listbox would not display previously selected frequency.
                -Setup.c test dialog: drops stereo test buttons when a mono soundcard is selected.
                -Setup.c test dialog: Test of Digi/Midi/FM will now output correct volume, when a volume is set.
                -Setup.c test dialog: Raised sound volumes of Digi/Midi/FM in case volume is not specified (-1).

2019:
- Added full support for episode 5: Sigil.
- Sound card settings are read from allegro.cfg again.

2023:
- Added full support for episode 6: Sigil II.
